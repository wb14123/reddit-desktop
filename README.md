Reddit Desktop
======================

This is a [Reddit](www.reddit.com) client designed for big screen. It is written with Electron so the article content is the same as you will see in a browser, and can be run on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

This software is currently usable but in a very early stage and it is one of my side projects. So contributions are very welcome.
